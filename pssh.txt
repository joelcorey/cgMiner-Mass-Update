pssh (parallel ssh):
-h hosts file
-l user
-A ask for password and pass it to SSH

sed (steam editor):
-i files to be edited "in-place"
-e is not necessary, stands for "expression" or script ... add the script to the commands to be executedS

pssh -h dgrL3test.txt -l root -A “cd /config"; sed -i ‘s/3FGWDqQ9eYRWTz4e4Ek1FJsmY4qNUwLzcz/omtest/g’ cgminer.conf; sed -i ‘s/x11.eu.nicehash.com:3336/prohashing:3333/g’ cgminer.conf; "reboot”

Looked at regex for 2 hours, fuck that

pssh -h dgrL3test.txt -l root -A “cd /config" 

command renamed to parallel-ssh on ubuntu .. extremely annoying. could add an alias command to make this convenient

parallel-ssh -h ./dgrL3test.txt -P -I < ./dgrL3testCommands.txt 
failed

parallel-ssh -h ./dgrL3test.txt -l root -A -P -I < ./dgrL3testCommands.txt
